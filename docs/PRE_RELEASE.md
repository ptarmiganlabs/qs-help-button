# Pre-release Process

This document describes how to create pre-releases (alpha, beta, release candidates) for helpbutton.qs.

## Overview

Pre-releases allow testing new features and fixes before general availability. They follow semantic versioning with pre-release identifiers (e.g., `2.5.0-alpha.1`, `2.5.0-beta.2`, `2.5.0-rc.1`).

## When to Use Pre-releases

- **Alpha**: Early testing of new features, may be unstable
- **Beta**: Feature-complete but needs broader testing
- **Release Candidate (RC)**: Stable enough for production testing before final release

## Creating a Pre-release

### Step 1: Create a Pre-release Branch

Create a branch from `main` following the naming convention:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b pre-release/alpha
# or
git checkout -b pre-release/beta
# or
git checkout -b pre-release/rc
```

### Step 2: Push the Branch

```bash
git push origin pre-release/alpha
# or
git push origin pre-release/beta
# or
git push origin pre-release/rc
```

### Step 3: Trigger the Workflow

The CI workflow will automatically detect the pre-release branch and:

1. Create a pre-release PR using release-please
2. Generate a pre-release tag (e.g., `v2.5.0-alpha.1`)
3. Create a draft GitHub release marked as "This is a pre-release"
4. Build and upload release artifacts

### Step 4: Review and Publish

1. Review the auto-generated PR
2. Merge the PR when ready
3. The workflow will create a draft release
4. Go to GitHub Releases and publish the draft
5. Make sure the "This is a pre-release" checkbox is checked

## Versioning Strategy

Pre-releases use the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-pre_release_identifier.N`

Examples:

- `2.5.0-alpha.1` - First alpha release
- `2.5.0-alpha.2` - Second alpha release
- `2.5.0-beta.1` - First beta release
- `2.5.0-rc.1` - First release candidate

## Promoting to Stable

When the pre-release is ready for general availability:

1. Merge all pre-release changes to `main`
2. The regular CI workflow will create a stable release (e.g., `2.5.0`)
3. Delete the pre-release branch (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Triggering

- Ensure the branch name starts with `pre-release/`
- Check the workflow runs tab for errors
- Verify the `RELEASE_PLEASE_PAT` secret is configured

### Version Number Issues

- Release-please automatically increments versions based on commit messages
- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)
- Pre-releases will increment the prerelease identifier (alpha.1, alpha.2, etc.)
