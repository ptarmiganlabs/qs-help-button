<!--
  Qlik Sense Help Button (Bug Report Variant) — Loader Snippet
  =============================================================
  Add this snippet to the Qlik Sense client.html file.

  Location of client.html on the Qlik Sense server:
    C:\Program Files\Qlik\Sense\Client\client.html

  The JS files must be placed in the Client folder (NOT in Client\resources):
    C:\Program Files\Qlik\Sense\Client\custom\qs-help-button.js
    C:\Program Files\Qlik\Sense\Client\custom\qs-help-button.config.js

  The Client folder is served by the Qlik Sense proxy as /resources.
  client.html is served at /sense/client.html with <base href="./">,
  so script src paths must use ../resources/ to resolve correctly.

  Insert the following lines just BEFORE the closing </body> tag.
  This is the ONLY modification needed to the out-of-the-box Qlik Sense files.

  IMPORTANT: After saving client.html, restart the Qlik Sense services.
  The proxy caches client.html at startup, so changes are not picked up
  until the services are restarted:
    PowerShell (elevated):  Get-Service QlikSense* | Restart-Service
